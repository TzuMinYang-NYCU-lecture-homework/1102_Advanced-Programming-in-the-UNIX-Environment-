break or b [running]: Setup a break point. If a program is loaded but is not running, you can simply display an error message. When a break point is hit, you have to output a message and indicate the corresponding address and instruction. The address of the break point should be within the range specified by the text segment in the ELF file and will not be the same as the entry point.
cont or c [running]: continue the execution when a running program is stopped (suspended).
delete [running]: remove a break point. Please remember to handle illegal situations, like deleting non-existing break points.
disasm or d [running]: Disassemble instructions in a file or a memory region. The address of each instruction should be within the range specified by the text segment in the ELF file. You only have to dump 10 instructions for each command. If disasm command is executed without an address, you can simply output ** no addr is given. Please note that the output should not have the machine code cc. See the demonstration section for the sample output format.
dump or x [running]: Dump memory content. You only have to dump 80 bytes from a given address. The output contains the addresses, the hex values, and printable ASCII characters. If dump command is executed without an address, you can simply output ** no addr is given. Please note that the output should include the machine code cc if there is a break point.
exit or q [any]: Quit from the debugger. The program being debugged should be killed as well.
get or g [running]: Get the value of a register. Register names are all in lowercase.
getregs [running]: Get the value of all registers.
help or h [any]: Show the help message.
list or l [any]: List break points, which contains index numbers (for deletion) and addresses.
load [not loaded]: Load a program into the debugger. When a program is loaded, you have to print out the address of entry point.
run or r [loaded and running]: Run the program. If the program is already running, show a warning message and continue the execution. If the program is loaded, start the program and continue the execution.
vmmap or m [running]: Show memory layout for a running program. If a program is not running, you can simply display an error message. The memory layout is:
[address] [perms] [offset] [pathname]
Check the demonstration section for the sample output format.
set or s [running]: Set the value of a register
si [running]: Run a single instruction, and step into function calls.
start [loaded]: Start the program and stop at the first instruction.
